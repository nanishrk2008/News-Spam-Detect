# Project Overview:

1. I'm proposing a new method to estimate K (the no. of clusters) in k-means. 
2. Implement this algorithm in Python; demonstrate its accuracy and scalability in the text mining domain. 
3. Apply it to detect spam or fake textual content (including news).

The algorithm, and status of the project so far, is described here:

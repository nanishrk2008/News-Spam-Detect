1a. INTERNAL CLUSTER MEASURES:
Silhouette statistic and the C-Index all compute SELECT distances rather than all distances. The C-Index also accounts for random chance the best, among all metrics, but this metric has high time complexity.

1b. THOSE APPLICABLE TO FUZZY: 
* Xie-Beni
* Fukuyama-Sugeno
* Gath and Geva (1989)--source: http://web.itu.edu.tr/~sgunduz/courses/verimaden/paper/validity_survey.pdf;  the one defined in "Well Separated Clusters And Optimal Fuzzy Partitions". Xie-Beni Index and PBM Index are fuzzy selective distance metrics extending those above.

2. EXTERNAL MEASURES by popularity:
1. normalized mutual-information
2. F-measure
3. Purity
4. Entropy

NOTES ON THESE EXTERNAL MEASURES:
* normalized mutual-information, Purity, and Entropy are reasonably correlated, while F-measure is poorly correlated with the other three measures
* Purity and the related Herfindahl index and precision/recall curve require equal number of clusters between ground truth and modeled (these all ignore correct determination of true number of classes)

WEBPAGE CORPUSES FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION: 
* create at least 3 manually grouped bookmark datasets to externally validate cluster algorithm
